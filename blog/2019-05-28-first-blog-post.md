### SWC replacing Babel by default

shuvi now uses Rust-based compiler [SWC](https://swc.rs/) to compile JavaScript/TypeScript. This new compiler is more faster than Babel and promoted better development experience.

### `Parcel/css` replacing Post-css by experimental

shuvi now uses Rust-based compiler [@parcel/css](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel-css) to compile and minifier css content.

This new compiler is more faster than Post-css and [excellent compression performance](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel-css#benchmarks).
