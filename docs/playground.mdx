# Playground

Playgrounds allow you to run Docusaurus **in your browser, without installing anything**!

They are mostly useful for:

- Testing Docusaurus
- Reporting bugs

Choose one of the available options below.

```mdx-code-block
import {PlaygroundCardsRow} from '@site/src/components/Playground';

<PlaygroundCardsRow />
```
