Welcome to the Shuvi.js documentation!

Shuvi.js is a meta framework that helps you build all kinds of application in a universal style.

It means to replace Next.js(for Server-Side Rendering Application), Create React App(for Client Application) and Nuxt.js(for Vue.js application).

Hope you like Shuvi.js.

:::info

Vue.js support is still in the plan.

## Getting Started

Create a new directory and init `package.json`

```sh
npx create-remix@latest
```

Install shuvi

```sh
npm i shuvi
```

Create `src/pages` directory, then generate a page with `hello, world`:

```sh
mkdir -p src/pages &&
echo "export default () => <div>hello, world</div>" > ./src/pages/index.js
```

Open `package.json` and add the following `scripts`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "shuvi dev",
    "build": "shuvi build",
    "serve": "shuvi serve"
  }
}
```

- `shuvi dev` - which starts shuvi in development mode
- `shuvi build` - which builds the application for production usage
- `shuvi serve` - which starts a shuvi production server
